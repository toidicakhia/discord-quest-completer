## 🚀 Key Features

* **Hybrid Execution Engine:** Runs video tasks in parallel for speed, while safely queuing game/stream tasks serially to prevent detection and crashes.
* **Traffic Control System (Anti-429):** Intelligent request queuing prevents "Too Many Requests" API bans by respecting rate limits automatically. It ensures 100% completion success.
* **Invisible Overlay Bypasser:** Simulates full game processes with metadata (window handle, fullscreen type) to trick Discord's internal detection without needing to download actual games.
* **Visual Dashboard:** Injects a beautiful, draggable overlay into Discord to track progress in real-time with custom SVG icons and progress bars.
* **Auto-Enroll & Loop:** Automatically accepts new quests, handles "Select Platform" glitches, and loops until all rewards are claimed.

## 🔓 Prerequisites: Enabling the Console

By default, the Developer Console is locked on the stable version of Discord. You have two options to access it:

### Option A: Use Discord Canary (Recommended)
The easiest way is to download **[Discord Canary](https://canary.discord.com/download)**.
This is the developer build of Discord, where the console is enabled by default.

### Option B: Unlock on Standard Discord
If you prefer using your standard Discord client, follow these steps to manually unlock the DevTools:

1.  Fully close Discord (ensure it's not running in the system tray).
2.  Press `Win + R` on your keyboard.
3.  Type `%appdata%/discord` and press Enter.
4.  Open the file named `settings.json` using Notepad or any text editor.
5.  Add the following line inside the curly brackets `{ ... }`:

    "DANGEROUS_ENABLE_DEVTOOLS_ONLY_ENABLE_IF_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOURE_DOING": true,

    *(Make sure to add a comma at the end of the previous line if necessary).*

6.  Save the file and restart Discord.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can tweak the internal settings at the top of the script code before pasting:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    VIDEO_SPEED: 5,        // Seconds of progress per tick (Safe: 5)
    GAME_CONCURRENCY: 4,   // Max simultaneous games (Recommended: 4)
    REQUEST_DELAY: 1500,   // Delay between API calls to prevent 429 errors
    FAKE_ACTIVITY: true    // Show "Playing..." status to friends
};
```
